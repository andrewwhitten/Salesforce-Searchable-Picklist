# Salesforce Searchable Picklist

Based on this <a href="https://github.com/akutishevsky/lwc-searchable-combobox"> by <a href="https://github.com/akutishevsky">Anton Kutishevsky</a>
This is a Salesforce LWC ComboBox control that gives you the ability to search through a picklist value set, which is useful when the list is long and/or contains the desired value in a different position:

Article in using this control in a Flow here:

<b>Attribution:</b> The LWC code was adapted from this <a href="https://salesforce.stackexchange.com/questions/395758/searchable-lightning-combobox-lwc">StackOverflow post</a> by <a href="https://github.com/akutishevsky">Anton Kutishevsky</a>. I made some changes to use a Global Picklist, added Flow metadata and not throw exceptions when used inside a Flow.
